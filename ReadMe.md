## About ##
This multi-page Streamlit app showcases exploratory data analysis and is a created small dashboard on a dataset with more than 100 rows of data, but I have added the option to provide your own data. Although I did add this feature along-side with it; I am not sure that is work 100% fully.

- **Bio**
